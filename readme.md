# Old Man Nerd Recipe Share

This site is a fun and slightly nerdy way to share recipes with each other.
It's based on [Chowdown.io](https://chowdown.io) - a simple, plaintext recipe database for hackers.

## Getting Started

### Writing a Recipe

The recipes are stored in the collection "Recipes" (the folder /_recipes).

They are written in Markdown and contain a few special sections:

- The frontmatter, which contains:
 - Title, Image, and Layout (which is "recipe")
 - Ingredients (a list of things in the dish)
 - Directions (a list of steps for the dish)
- Body content (for intros, stories, written detail)

If you need help with Markdown, here's a [handy cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Writing a component recipe

A component recipe is a special recipe made up of other recipes. To make a new component recipe:

- place your smaller, single recipes into the /_components folder
- make a new recipe like normal in the /_recipes folders
- in the frontmatter of this new recipe, include your recipes from the /_components folder (instead of the usual Ingredeints list)

You can an example on the Red Berry Tart recipe.

## Previewing

### Docker-Compose

The easiest way to build and preview the site is by using the included
docker-compose.yml file:

```docker-compose up```

Then navigating to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).  As changes
are saved the site will be automatically rebuilt. Just refresh your browser.

### Insall Jekyll Locally

This is a Jekyll build. Make sure you have Jekyll [installed](https://jekyllrb.com/). To install, run this command in the terminal (or iTerm, etc):

```gem install bundler jekyll```

or to check if you've got it installed already:

```jekyll -v```

Clone or download this repo. Navigate to the folder in terminal (or iTerm, etc), and then run:

```jekyll serve```

With default settings, you should be able to view the site locally at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
