ingredients:
- 2 large acorn squash halved and seeded
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium sweet onion diced
- 1/4 cup vegetable stock white wine or water for deglazing
- 1 clove garlic minced
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar plus more to taste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- Hot sauce (optional)
- Plain Greek yogurt (optional)
- Cilantro leaves or thyme for garnish (optional)
- Additional cumin and paprika for garnish (optional)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
- Place the squash, flesh side up, in a baking pan with high sides, pouring about an inch of water in the bottom of the pan. Cover the squash with foil and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until fork tender.
- While the squash is baking, heat a large skillet over medium-low heat and add in just enough olive oil to coat the pan, about 1 tablespoon.
- Add the onions to the pan and stir to coat with oil. Let the onions caramelize over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30-35 minutes, or until the onions are a deep brown. As the pan dries out, add in a splash of stock, white wine or water to deglaze, then stir. The onions should be soft but not mushy when they're done. Add the minced garlic to the pan about 10 minutes before the onions are finished caramelizing.
- Remove the onions from the heat and set aside. Remove the squash from the oven and allow it to cool enough to handle. Scoop out the squash flesh into a food processor or blender.
- Add the onion mixture, honey or maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice and spices to the processor and blend until just smooth.
- Serve warm, cold or room temperature as-is or add in yogurt, a drizzle of Sriracha or another hot sauce, and/or cilantro, thyme, paprika and/or cumin for garnish.
